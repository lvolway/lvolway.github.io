  <div class="column1"><h2>Bodoni</h2>
        <p>Designer: Giambattista Bodoni</p>
        <p>When: late eighteenth century, 1798</p>
        <p>Where: Parma, Italy </p>
        <p>Purpose: “The Bodoni typeface has been used for a wide variety of different materials. In the eighteenth century it was used in Italian books to 1960s periodicals. In the 21st century, the late manner versions were used in advertising. The early manner versions were used for fine book printing. There is a list of about 15 different companies that uses the Bodoni typeface or one of its variants. It can be seen used in Mama Mia posters. It is also one of the two typesets used in the Hilton Hotel restaurant and bar menu. Another place its can be seen is in the Nirvana logo.”</p></div>
  <div class="column2"><h2>Didot</h2>
        <p>Designer: The Didot Family</p>
        <p>When: between 1784 and 1811</p>
        <p>Where: Paris, France </p>
        <p>Purpose: “Development began on the face in 1783, and was first published in 1784. In the years following the face’s first usages (such as a Latin Bible in 1785 and the Discourse of Bossuet in 1786), Firmin continued to increase the contrast, and became the first person in the history of typography to record a font family with half-point increments. Later, after development of the face had ended, Pierre used it in his masterpiece, an 1819 edition of Voltaire’s La Henriade, shown at right. The Didot typeface would be considered the standard in French printing for over a century.” </p></div>

         <h1>Compare & Contrast</h1>  
            <h3>Let's take a closer look at how are these fonts compare to one another.</h3>
        
        <hr>
            <p>When looking at Bodoni and Didot side by side, the first thing to notice is that Bodoni is a heavier font than Didot. When comparing these fonts side by side Bodoni looks much darker, the lines are thicker throughout the font. You can see this in diagram 2 which compares the letter “A” from both fonts. Bodoni is more bold and condensed in comparison to Didot, which feels more delicate and uses a lot of white space. This is even evident in the size and spacing of the fonts. Bodoni is close to the edge of the textbox and leaves less breathing room between letters while Didot is more spread out and the letters are larger, with more space surrounding each character as you can see in diagram 3 where the text box is highlighted in red. This is also very obvious in diagram 4 which shows the word “Handgloves” in both fonts. In this diagram both fonts are set to 50pts and Didot is naturally larger than Bodoni because it uses much more white space. This makes Bodoni look much more condensed and blocky next to Didot. The letters appear to be very similar in style but Bodoni is more squared off while Didot’s corners are more smooth as you can see on the “S” in diagram 3. Didot has more sharp corners overall in comparison to Bodoni. In diagram 5, the letter “W” from both fonts are compared side by side. The “W” for Bodoni is thicker, with more extra lines than in the “W” for Didot. The “W” for Didot also has a lot more white space in between each line.
